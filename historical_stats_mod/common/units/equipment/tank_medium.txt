	# All equipment based on medium tank chassis

	################## 1st part rework: Armour/ Hardness/ Piercing (Base: 37AT/15mm Plate = 40Piercing/25 Armor/39 Hardness) 
	################## 2nd part: IC / Resources (Weight & Weapon & Tank Type based. Tanks with low IC compared to weight need more materials per day to balance i.e. TD)
	################## 3rd part: Soft / Hard / Defense / Breakthrough / Reliability / Speed (Adjust these for game balance... better depending on Tank Type)
	################## NOTE: All basic medium tank types have battalions with size 45. Other have 30 (AGs) or  24 (TD / SPART / AA) 
	################## Speed adjusted roughly to (Max speed kmh) / 10 + 2
