fra_infantry_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The FT was the first production tank to have its armament within a fully rotating turret and its configuration – crew compartment at the front, engine compartment at the back, and main armament in a revolving turret – became and remains the standard tank layout. As such it is sometimes called the world's first modern tank. \n Many smaller units assembled after the start of WWII also used it. This usage gave rise to the popular myth that the French had no modern equipment at all; in fact, they had more modern tanks than the Germans. The French suffered from tactical and strategic weaknesses rather than from equipment deficiencies. When the best French units were cut off by the Germans the complete French reserve of 575 FTs were sent to the front. The Wehrmacht captured 1,704 FTs. They used about 750 for patrolling occupied Europe.\n Over 3,000 built, most of them during 1918."

fra_infantry_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed from 1933 and produced from 1936, the type was intended as a light infantry support tank, equipping autonomous tank battalions, that would be allocated to individual infantry divisions to assist them in executing offensive operations. To this end it was relatively well-armoured but slow and lacking a good antitank-capacity, fitted with a short 37 mm gun. At the outbreak of the war, the antitank-role was more emphasized leading to the development and eventual production from April 1940 of a subtype with a more powerful longer gun, the Renault R40. It was planned to shift new production capacity to the manufacture of other faster types, but due to the defeat of France the R35/40 remained the most numerous French tank of the war, about 1685 vehicles having been produced by June 1940, many exported to Poland, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia. For the remainder of the war Germans used them, some of them rebuilt into tank destroyers."

fra_infantry_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "An improvement of the Renault R35, of which it is often considered a variant. \n Using six vertical coil springs covered with 8 mm armour plating with twelve road wheels per side and number of other improvements such as a longer and thus much more powerful SA38 Long 35 37 mm gun in the adapted cast APX-R1 turret, giving the type a good antitank capacity, and a tail to facilitate climbing. The number of rounds carried decreased from 102 to 90. A fundamental advance in tactical effectiveness compared to the R 35 was that the R 40s were equipped with a radio set, which had not been standard for any French light tank until then."

fra_infantry_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The Hotchkiss H35 or Char léger modèle 1935 H was a French cavalry tank. Despite having been designed as a rather slow but well-armoured light infantry support tank, the type was initially rejected by the French Infantry because it proved difficult to steer while driving cross-country and was instead adopted in 1936 by the French Cavalry. \nThe Hotchkiss H35 was a small vehicle, 4.22 metres long, 1.95 m wide and 2.133 m tall and weighing 10.6–11.37 tonnes. Armed with the short 37 mm SA 18 gun, which had a maximum armour penetration of only 23 mm, maximum armour thickness was specified as 40 mm but there were persistent quality problems, worsened by the fact that many subcontractors had to be used.  The normal speed on road and flat terrain was 28 km/h. About 550 Hotchkiss tanks were captured and used by the Germans. \n 1200 built"

fra_infantry_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Char léger modèle 1935 H modifié 39, which from 1940 was also fitted with a longer, more powerful 37 mm gun. The H39 was an overhaul of the previous model, with a new Hotchkiss 6-cyl. 5.97 liters engine giving 120 hp at 2800 rpm. With a power-to-weight ratio of 10 hp/ton (the weight rose to 12.1 tons), top speed was now 36.5 km/h on road and range increased to 150 km thanks to a new gasoline 207 liter tank. The new engine imposed a redesigned hood, the rear being raised and now nearly horizontal. It was intended to make this improved variant the standard light tank, with at least four thousand produced to equip new armoured divisions of both the Cavalry and the Infantry, but due to the defeat of France in June 1940 total production of both subtypes was limited to about 1200 vehicles."

When Hotchkiss first proposed, in 1935, to mass-produce a simple and cheap infantry tank, the Army turned to others contractors to compete, FCM was among them. \n The FCM 36 was seen as the most advanced French tank and should function as a test bed for further improvements. The first series FCM 36 was indeed delivered on May 2, 1938, and the others followed until March 1939. In the meantime, the manufacturer revised its costs to 900,000 FF apiece, twice the original price and as FCM was also involved in building the B1, an announcement was made that no other FCM 36 would be expected for delivery until September 1940.\n Speed 24 km/h, Armament 37 mm SA18, Reibel 7.5 mm MG, Armor 40 mm. \n Total production 100"

fra_infantry_tank_equipment_8_desc:0 "AMX 38 was a prototype French tank designed in 1937 at the AMX works. Designed as AMX's response to the 20-tonne tank programme intended to replace the ageing Char D2, it was a faster and heavier alternative to Renault R35, in practice a cross-over between a light and medium tank. In 1938 two prototypes were built, the first armed with a 37 mm SA 38 gun, the second with the 47 mm SA 35 gun mounted in a centrally-located conical turret almost identical to the one used by Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée on FCM 36 tank. The suspension designed by Molinié was of typical AMX design of the epoch, similar to the one used in Renault R40, protected on the sides by an armoured plate similar to the one used on D2 tank. The crew consisted of two people: driver and commander/gunner. Trials of both prototypes were underway when war broke out and no serial production followed."

fra_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The history of the “D” series, began after the WWI. In 1928 Renault succeeded in his attempt to get his Renault NC accepted as the basis for further light infantry tank development; he was granted an order to build two prototypes. The Army called this project the Char D. In May 1930 Renault was asked to develop two derived types, the Char D2 and the Char D3; the original Char D now received as designation Char D1.\n The Army was not satisfied with this model and tried to get rid of them. They decided in 1936-1937 to send the whole lot into the colonies. The hopeless situation of May 1940 led to decision to repatriate as many existing D1s possible.\nMaximum speed 18.6 km/h, Armament 47 mm SA34 with 160 rounds, 2x Reibel 7.5 mm machine guns (1 coaxial, 1 nose), Armor 10-40 mm \n Used in battalions with medium tanks. \nTotal of 160 built"

fra_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Even while the Renault D1 was still in development, a heavier version was requested by a directive of the direction de l’infanterie from 23 January 1930. This called for a medium tank with 40 mm of armor, that was faster (22 km/h) than the D1, which in turn required a far more powerful engine. A modern cast turret APX-1 fitted with a SA-34 short barrel 47 mm gun and a coaxial Reibeil 7.5 mm  machine-gun with a hemispheric observation cupola waas chosen.  The commander was seated in the turret. As usual in this configuration, he had to operate the gun (loading, aiming and firing), serve the coaxial machine-gun and command the tank at the same time. In most respects, the D2 was a slightly enlarged D1, retaining many features of the previous vehicle, like the vertical coil suspension design.\n 100 built - D2 bis included"

fra_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Renault D2 bis M.Tank"
fra_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The second series of Renault Char D2 was mostly differing by the use of a more modern APX-4 turret, bearing a 47 mm SA-35 long barrel gun, quite effective against tanks. PPLR X 160 episcopes replaced the older Chrétien type, and there was a S 190 G attachment point on the roof for an extra 7.5 mm  AA machine gun. Improved greasing system, modified idler wheels and sprockets, ball bearings, shorter mudguards, a new Vertex distributor and Vlex starter completed this overhaul. \n When the war broke out, Edouard Daladier confirmed mass production of the type, however deliveries were kept low, three-five vehicles per month."

fra_medium_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Arguably the most obscure French tank in 1940, only a few AMC 34s were built, as a preseries, before a change of specifications made the design unfit, as its light hull couldn’t sustain thicker armor. Eventually, this would lead to the production of the AMC 35, a much better tank, which arrived too late and again, in too small numbers, although promising. At the origin, it was part of the several automitrailleuses types being looked into in 1931 for the cavalry, with the looming specter of the massive Red Army. The 9-tons Automitrailleuse de Combat (AMC) was to be capable of cruising at 30 km/h cross-country and armed with a 47 mm main gun. The plan was approved by the Supreme Command in December 1932. \nThe first units fielded in 1936 had reshaped Renault FT turrets, and were later given surplus APX1 turrets and SA 34 47 mm guns.\n 12 built, used together with medium tanks."

fra_medium_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "In 1931, French armor units were about to be massively equipped with infantry support light tanks, like the Renault R35 and Hotchkiss H35. However, the specifications of the time called for a cavalry medium tank. This meant a fast tank. Renault already had experience with the D1 and D2 medium infantry support models. This led Renault to create the AMC 34 (for “Automitrailleuse de Combat”). But in 1934, the specification was altered, now requesting a better armored and faster model. Renault then redesigned its plans around the same basis to save time, creating the AMC 35. \n The prototype had a two-man APX2 turret, with the commander/loader on the left and the gunner on the right, fitted with a 25 mm SARF fortress gun and a 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun. As the 25 mm antitank guns were needed in the Maginot line, in the production series the 47 mm SA 35 gun was used. \n  57 built"

fra_medium_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "SOMUA was the first cavalry vehicle properly called a tank. It was classed as a fast medium, not aimed only at reconnaissance, but also contact and engagement with advanced enemy units. The hull and turret maximum thickness were around 47 and 40 mm (1.85/1.5 in) respectively. The turret was derived from that of the B1 heavy tank, but with an enlarged turret ring, allowing both the tank commander and the gun operator to be in at the same time. The medium-barrel SA35 47 mm was efficient against most German and Soviet tanks of the time, using a provision of 90 AP and 28 HE shots. There was also a coaxial 7.5 mm Reibel MG. All S35 units were scheduled to be equipped with radio, but only one tank in five was equipped, despite the fact that many of them included an antenna. \n Speed 40km/h, Armor up to 48 mm\n Total production 430."

After the defeat of France, captured Char B1 (bis) would be used by Germany, with some rebuilt as flamethrowers or mechanised artillery. It was served by the radioman and the commander, who was also given the task of aiming and firing the turret 47 mm gun. The 75 mm howitzer could fire HE and APHE rounds, only suitable against fortifications, with a poor traverse of only one degree. The aiming was given to the driver.\n Speed 28km/h.
