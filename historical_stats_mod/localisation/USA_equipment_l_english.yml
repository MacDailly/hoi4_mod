american_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M1 Combat Car, officially Light Tank, M1, was a light tank used by the U.S. Cavalry in the late 1930s and developed at the same time as the infantry's very similar M2 light tank. After the Spanish Civil War, most armies, including the U.S. Army, realized that they needed tanks armed with cannons, not merely vehicles armed with machine guns and so the M1 became obsolete. "

The quick fall of France, due to inadequate tactics, quickly led the US Army Corps to think about a new doctrine, which led to an independent US armored force. \n The M3 was, at first, a simple upgrade of the last M2, with a more powerful Continental petrol engine, a new vertical volute spring suspension system and up to four machine guns in addition to a main, quick-firing M5 (and later M6) 37 mm anti-tank gun. \nAbout 13,860 M3's built"

american_light_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The core reason behind the development of the M5 was probably the rapidly growing demand for radial engines, which were in short supply. The turret, main hull, tracks, suspension system, almost everything including equipment, were derived from the M3A3. Despite criticism about its lack of firepower, the 37 mm was kept. Its high-velocity performances made it able to pierce the armor of similar light tanks. As a scout tank, it was mostly confronted with infantry, and the three Browning machine-guns were also an argument.\n About 13,860 built"

It had modern torsion bar suspensions, completely revised welded steel armor, improved protection and, more importantly, a much more potent lightweight 75 mm main gun. Although late in the game (just in time for the Battle of the Bulge, winter 1944), the Chaffee was so successful, being efficient, simple, reliable and rugged, that that it was largely exported after the war and stayed in service with many armies until the 1980s and beyond. \n 4731 built"

The vehicle was designed to be air-transportable, and the desired anti-tank capabilities were provided by installing a long 76 mm gun with an advanced rangefinder. In 1949, with the adoption of a less ambitious rangefinder, the project's designation was changed to T41. Production started in 1951 at Cleveland's Cadillac Tank Plant, and by 1953 the new tank completely replaced the M24 in the United States Army. Initially it was nicknamed "Little Bulldog", then renamed "Walker Bulldog" after General Walton Walker, who was killed in a jeep accident in Korea in 1950. \n 5,500 built"

This became the T42 37 mm Gun Motor Carriage. The army then changed their request to a vehicle mounting a 57 mm gun, thus the designation changed to the T49 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage. Yet another change, requesting a 75 mm  gun, led to the T67 Gun Motor Carriage, of which one was built from a T49 chassis.

After the early, soon obsolete M10 Wolverine and the superfast M18 Hellcat, the US Army needed a more powerful gun and better armored vehicle to hunt down the latest developments in German tanks, including the Panther and Tigers. Indeed, in September 1942, it was already foreseen that the standard 75 mm  M7 gun of the M10 was only efficient at short range (500 m) against the enemy vehicles. Engineers were tasked with devising a new 90 mm gun, which became the M3 gun, to engage German tanks on equal terms considering range. This gun was also used by the M26 Pershing.\n 1,772 built"

The Marmon-Herrington Company then came forward with their own design which was approved and in April 1942 a trial vehicle was produced and sent to Fort Benning, Georgia for testing. \n Like it’s invertebrate namesake, the M22 was fast. Propelled by the 165 hp Lycoming O-435T horizontally opposed 6-cylinder gasoline engine, the tank could reach, in theory, 40 mph (64 km/h). More than fast enough for it to save itself from a sticky situation. The main armament consisted of the 37 mm Tank Gun M6.

The tall hull of the M2 was litteraly bristling with firepower, with no less than seven M1919 Browning standard cal.30 (7.62 mm) machine guns, and nine in maximal configuration. The main armament was the M3 37 mm (1.46 in) anti-tank high-velocity gun, also borrowed from the Light M2.

It was given the official service name 105 mm Self Propelled Gun, Priest by the British Army. For the duration of the war, the workhorse of the motorized artillery units was a derivative of the most produced tracked platform in the US Army, the M4 Sherman tank. In 1941, US Army observers noticed that more firepower would be needed to support armored operations. Before experiments were made with the Sherman in 1944 with a 105 mm  howitzer in the turret, building SPGs was the easiest way to achieve this, as there were few constraints on the gun carried. The T19 half-tracks were developed for this task, but still lacked protection and off-road capabilities.

american_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Little known, the M6 was the first modern US heavy tank. Had vertically-stabilized 76.2 mm gun coupled with a coaxial 37 mm gun. The production M6A1 series vehicles were given a two-piece cupola hatch and ring mount for an AA cal.50 (12.7 mm). However, the Armored Corps had quickly grasped the utility of having a single tank type in service, cheaper and easier to transport, such as the Sherman, and the production was stopped. The development, however, did not end there. Another project would eventually lead to the excellent M26 Pershing.  \n 12 built "

american_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M26 Pershing descended from a long series of medium and heavy tank prototypes, dating back from 1936. During the war, heavy tank development had been long delayed or given low priority since the US Army, USMC and Allied forces required a mass-built, good-all-around medium tank, which took the shape of the Medium M4 Sherman. By 1944, the High Command was aware of the limitation of the M4 when facing German tanks. By mid-1944, both the British and US had undertaken upgrades in armor and guns on the Sherman, and developed tank-hunters instead of mass-producing a brand new model. However, by the fall of 1944, these stopgap measures proved insufficient, and the innovative M26 was eventually pushed forward for production. \n Armament 90 mm gun M3, cal.50 M2Hb (12.7 mm), 2xcal.30 (7.62 mm) M1919A4. Armor: Glacis front 100 mm, sides 75 mm, turret 76 mm. Production 2212. "

american_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "After the end of the war, the Soviet heavy tanks became the new threat as these were designed to deal with the very same tanks and now were antagonized to their former allies. The IS-3 and IS-4 series have in common a strong frontal armor, sloped and 180 mm thick, and a 122 mm gun as a standard. That imposed a fitting answer by the British Army with the Conqueror, while the US Army, after a long line of prototypes, ordered the T43E1 in 1953–54 at Chrysler’s Newark plant. After several improvements, by 1956 the T48E1 was standardized as the M103. \n Armament 120 mm gun M48, 38 roundsSec. Armor	Max. 280 mm. 300 built. "

But the design of the engine deck and exhaust vents were completely changed in accordance to the new engine. Other changes included rear fender mufflers with shield, and a bore evacuator with a smaller SBMB on the main gun. By 1951, the M46A1 main external modification concerned the new 90 mm barrel fitted with a reshaped muzzle brake, bore evacuator and single baffle muzzle brake with internal compensator spring to reverse the muzzle exhaust and further reduce the recoil.

Armor was 4 in (100/102 mm), with a well sloped front beak. The real change was the much roomier and higher turret, characterized by a long rear bustle, well protected, which sloped sides which gave its charecteristic “pear” shaped section.

The M47 has been largely a stopgap model, made from the marriage of the T42 tank prototype (the real successor of the M46) and the M46 chassis, itself an improvement over the ww2 M26 Pershing. Most were replaced in the US Army and Marine Corps when the M48 was made available and sold abroad. The M48 was instead a radical technical departure, adopting a brand new turret and chassis, revised suspensions, more powerful engine and many other improvements.\n Main armament: 90 mm gun M41, Armor Max: Nose glacis/turret 110 mm \n Around 12,000 built"

It was nothing more than an evolution of the type, but modified too extensively in too many ways to be considered by the US Ordnance a simple version of the latter. It was officially standardized as the 105 mm Gun Full Tracked Combat Tank M60. With more than 15,000 built over a large period of time, modernized in various ways, it was still in service in the US in 1997, and is still frontline with many armies in the world today, a testimony to the soundness of the original design.\n 105 mm gun M68, Max 155mm armor, +15000 built.
