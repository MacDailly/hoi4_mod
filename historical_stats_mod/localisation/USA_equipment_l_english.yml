american_light_tank_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M1917 light tank. In 1917 US Army Expeditionary Force did not possess any tanks, so the Americans conducted negotiations with the French government and obtained the license to start production of the Renault FT tank in America. For security reasons, the early tanks were just called ‘6 ton special tractor’. Later, they were given the official designation Model 1917 6-ton light tank. The American engineers made some alterations to the original French Renault FT tank design. Some of these features were cosmetic and others were done to assist in the problem of supplying none standard ammunition and equipment to front line troops. \n 950 built"

american_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M2 light tank, officially Light Tank M2, was an American light tank which saw limited use during World War II. The M2A1 was the series production vehicle, equipped with a single turret, of which only ten units were built in 1936. However, it quickly appeared that the Army wanted a twin-turret configuration, favored at the time by other armies. The design was changed and new turrets were devised, which led to the mass-produced M2A2. "

After the Spanish Civil War, most armies, including the U.S. Army, realized that they needed tanks armed with cannons, not merely vehicles armed with machine guns and so the M1 became obsolete. "

One of these turrets housed the main .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine gun, while the other had the .30 cal (7.62 mm) caliber M1919. \n 239 units were produced, quickly becoming the staple of US infantry tank troops until 1937. Although displaying an obsolete configuration, these tanks were popularly known as the “Mae West”, after the famous busty actress. By 1937, a new set of modifications was in line. The suspensions were revised, the hull slightly lengthened and the bogies placed farther apart, while the front armor was increased to 25 mm (0.98 in). Only 72 units of this M2A3 version were produced due to a rapid change of specifications."

The quick fall of France, due to inadequate tactics, quickly led the US Army Corps to think about a new doctrine, which led to an independent US armored force. \n The M3 was, at first, a simple upgrade of the last M2, with a more powerful Continental petrol engine, a new vertical volute spring suspension system and up to four machine guns in addition to a main, quick-firing M5 (and later M6) 37 mm anti-tank gun. \n In all, 13,859 M3 were built."

From that point, the sponson machine guns were removed, as the three remaining machine guns were judged sufficient for the task. 4621 M3A1s were produced, the last delivered in February 1943. They were largely distributed to the British under the Stuart Mk.III designation, while the diesel variant was named Stuart Mk.IV. They also had an improved gun vertical stabilizer."

The M5A1 was the second production version of the M5, characteristic feature was the addition of large protective sand skirts over the upper tracks.\n 8884 M5 built"

In an attempt to give the HMC M8A1 more anti-armor capabilities, development began on mounting the 75 mm Gun M3, as found on the M4 Sherman, into the turret with a new thicker mantlet. The idea was to create a fast, lightweight tank-destroyer that could exploit an opening, open fire, then retreat. The fast and small M5/M8 chassis was seen as a perfect candidate. Despite this, the project was canceled, as the M18 Hellcat was looming on the horizon."

In 1949, with the adoption of a less ambitious rangefinder, the project's designation was changed to T41. Production started in 1951 at Cleveland's Cadillac Tank Plant, and by 1953 the new tank completely replaced the M24 in the United States Army.

Yet another change, requesting a 75 mm  gun, led to the T67 Gun Motor Carriage, of which one was built from a T49 chassis.

During the war, heavy tank development had been long delayed or given low priority since the US Army, USMC and Allied forces required a mass-built, good-all-around medium tank, which took the shape of the Medium M4 Sherman. By 1944, the High Command was aware of the limitation of the M4 when facing German tanks. By mid-1944, both the British and US had undertaken upgrades in armor and guns on the Sherman, and developed tank-hunters instead of mass-producing a brand new model. However, by the fall of 1944, these stopgap measures proved insufficient, and the innovative M26 was eventually pushed forward for production. \n Armament 90 mm gun M3, cal.50 M2Hb (12.7 mm), 2xcal.30 (7.62 mm) M1919A4.

Another prototype was produced, testing the T15E2 gun. These two prototypes had two recuperators on top of the gun, in order to help manage the stronger recoil of the gun. The second prototype, with the T15E2 two-piece ammunition gun, was the basis for the T26E4 production vehicles. In March 1945, a limited procurement of 1000 T26E4s was authorized, replacing the same number of M26 Pershings ordered.
